## Day One — The First Beat  
**Date:** 19 September 2025  
**Milestone:** joinpulse.eu goes live with the first heartbeat landing page.  

**Actions:**  
- Domains secured (`joinpulse.eu`, backups).  
- Email backbone created (Tuta + Proton).  
- DNS records set (A, AAAA, MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC).  
- GitHub repo created.  
- Landing page deployed with static background, red pulse button, and tagline.  
- **Enforce HTTPS enabled** (site secured with SSL).  

**Symbol:**  
- The pulse circle.  
- The static grain.  
- Tagline: *“1 Human 1 Account …are you on the pulse?”*  

**Witness:**  
- Roos, first live feedback:  
  > “Aww is that static? No way, I love this… 1 Human 1 Account. How class.”  

**Impact:**  
- From words and visions to reality.  
- Pulse One is no longer an idea — it beats in the open.  
- The first signal sent.  
- Shield raised on Day One — the site is already HTTPS-secured.

## Next Target — Day Two  
**Goal:** Start building the story outward.  
- Share the site with a small trusted circle (3–5 people).  
- Capture their first reactions for the log.  
- Draft the second log entry: *“First witnesses beyond Roos.”*  

**Outcome:** The pulse spreads from one to many.
